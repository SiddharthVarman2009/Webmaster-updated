  <h1 style="color: green; text-align: right; margin-right: 1000px;">Make the Earth Green Again</h1>
    <p class="description">Greenhouse gases are a major threat to our planet. As it can cause global warming to happen. Global warming can cause many serious alterations to the environment, impacting human health as well as the health of other living organisms that inhabit our planet. Global warming is a major threat because it can cause sea levels to rise, increasing the planet's overall temperature. To make Earth green again, we have come up with clean energy home solutions that will make our Earth more green again and reduce the negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment. </p>


   <h3 style ="color:black;">Geothermal Heat Pumps</h3>
    <p class="description" style="width: 50%;"> Geothermal heat pumps, also known as ground source or water source heat pumps, transfer heat into and out of the home, using the ground as both a heat source and a heat sink.Geothermal heat pumps are made up of a high-density plastic which is more durable and does not corrode unlike other heat pump systems made up of copper.
These heat pumps are extremely efficient</p>

      <h3 style ="color:black;">Solar Panels</h3>
      <p class="description" style="width:100%;"> Solar panels are another great way to reduce the negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment. Solar panels use photosynthesis to create electricity without emitting pollutants like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. When the sun shines onto a solar panel, energy from the sunlight is absorbed by the PV cells in the panel. This energy creates electrical charges that move in response to an internal electrical field in the cell, causing electricity to flow. Solar panels are usually made from silicon, or another semiconductor material installed in a metal panel frame with a glass casing. When this material is exposed to photons of sunlight, it releases electrons and produces an electric charge.
 This is why solar panels are a great way to reduce air pollution. Solar panels use solar radiation from the sun and use it to create electricity. Solar panels are also renewable, and they will never run out of energy. Solar panels can be placed on top of the roof of your house. </p>
